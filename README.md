# Managers of Liverpool FC

This repo houses analyses of historical Liverpool FC results. It uses the `engsoccerdata` package by [James Curley](https://github.com/jalapic). You can find documentation for this package [here](https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata). 

The Liverpool FC managers data is from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Liverpool_F.C._managers). 

The R Notebook for this analysis [can be viewed here](https://restrellado.github.io/liverpoolfc/lfc_managers.html). 

The results of this exploration were polished up and used in two blog posts about 
Liverpool. You can read those here:
