# Managers of Liverpool FC

This repo houses analyses of historical Liverpool FC results. It uses the `engsoccerdata` package by [James Curley](https://github.com/jalapic). You can find documentation for this package [here](https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata). 

The Liverpool FC managers data is from Wikipedia. I stored the dataframe in Google Sheets and exported it as a CSV stored in the `data` folder.
